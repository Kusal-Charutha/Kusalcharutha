                <h1>How Tesla Cars Become Famouse</h1>
				<br>
                <br>
				<h3>Tesla Cars</h3>
				<p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, 
                    quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars.
                </p>
                <br>
				<h3>Why Tesla Become Famouse</h3>
				<p>Tesla’s release has been a hit with not only car buyers, but also catapulted the company into the spotlight as one of the few successful independent automakers along with being a pioneer when it comes to the electric car market.
                    The Model S, a sleek luxury sedan that starts at $79,990, has received top ratings from the trade industry and the press.
                    Shen the Model S first came out in 2013 Tesla made headlines when trade press gave it laurels. The electric plug-in car received a near perfect score of 99 out of 100 from Consumer Reports, which also named it as “the best car ever tested.”
                    <br/><br/>
                    By September 2014 the car hit all-time sales records in the U.S. with 2,500 sold,5﻿ and in Q1 2015 sales reached a new high at 10,030.6﻿ It is now considered a staple within the electric car stratosphere. The company’s market capitalization, as of May 4, 2020 was $138.8 billion.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The seeds of the company go back to 1990.Tesla is not an overnight success, and it is no longer a start-up so much as it is a pioneer in the electric car market.

                <h3>Roadster 2008</h3>
				<p> In 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roadster. 
                    In company tests, it achieved 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge, a range unprecedented for a production electric car. 
                    Additional tests showed that its performance was comparable to that of many gasoline-powered sports cars: 
                    the Roadster could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles (96 km) per hour in less than four seconds and could reach a top speed of 125 miles (200 km) per hour. 
                    The lightweight car body was made of carbon fibre.

                </p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Model S</h3>
				<p> Without it we wouldn't have the growing selection of electric vehicles we have today, yet the 2022 Tesla Model S remains one of the most compelling and desirable options in that growing market segment. 
                    With up to 412-miles of estimated driving range—depending upon model—the S can easily be used for long drives, and the 1020-hp Plaid version can deliver supercar acceleration while seating four adults. 
                    The Model S is also practical, with a large rear cargo area and a secondary front-trunk for extra space. New entrants in the luxury EV sedan category includes the Porsche Taycan and the Audi e-tron GT, 
                    both of which challenge the Model S in terms of performance and comfort, 
                    but its superior range and available semi-autonomous driving technology continue to draw consumers to this Tesla.

                </p>
				<br/>
                <br/>
				<h3>Model 3</h3>
				<p> With a near ideal blend of performance, driving range, and accessible pricing, the 2022 Tesla Model 3 is an electric vehicle that lives up to the hype.
                     It's fast—especially the Performance trim—and it's agile, which means the Model 3 is an EV that driving enthusiasts like us can get behind. 
                     Driving range is an impressive 358 miles per charge on the mid-level Long Range trim, so it's not necessary to charge the Model 3 every day. 
                     It's attractive entry price doesn't unlock the Model 3's full potential, 
                    though, and its fit and finish doesn't quite match alternatives such as the Chevy Bolt and Ford Mustang Mach E.
                     Still, there's not a more inexpensive way to park one of Tesla's groundbreaking EVs in your driveway.
                    <img src="https://evchargeplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tesla-model3-evchargeplus-00.png" >

                </p>
				<br/>
                <br/>
				<h3>Model X</h3>
				<p> The 2022 Tesla Model X is a prime example of the EV automakers' brand ethos. Quick, high-tech, and featuring a flashy gimmick in its Falcon-wing rear doors, 
                    it presents a unique-but-expensive proposition in the growing EV-crossover segment. The Model X comes standard with two electric motors making a total of 670 horsepower and all-wheel drive; 
                    a three-motor version called Plaid makes an astounding 1020 horsepower and is said to shoot to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds. That mega-motor version will be available in late 2022 according to Tesla. The Model X isn't as agile as the mechanically similar Model S sedan, 
                    but it's surprisingly agile given its size and weight. The cabin is an exercise in modernism, with a giant screen dominating the dashboard providing touch-sensitive access to most of the Model X's features. 
                    A third row of seats provides room for the whole family, and the second row can be ordered with captain's chairs.

                </p>
				<br/>
                <br/>
				<h3>Model Y</h3>
				<p> The Tesla Model Y tried to capitalize on the red-hot success of the Model 3, but the all-electric crossover is more fizzle than sizzle. 
                    Whereas the Model 3 nails its mission with a handling that dances and impressive range, the 2022 Model Y feels like a lazy effort to appeal to the SUV-buying public. 
                    Its handling is less engaging than the 3’s and its cabin—while largely carry-over from the sedan—doesn't do enough to differentiate itself, which serves only to magnify our criticism of both its fit-and-finish and the problems that the all-digital environment creates. 
                    It's not entirely without value, though. Its estimated driving range is good compared with rivals such as the Ford Mustang Mach E and the Volkswagen ID.4, and the Long Range trim promises up to 330 miles per charge. 
                    Plus, the Tesla is available with an optional third row of seats which is still rare in the world of EVs SUVs.

                </p>
				<br/>
                <br/>
				<h3>Cybertruck</h3>
				<p> The Tesla Cybertruck looks like it was dropped off by an alien race, but it has the capabilities to challenge all of the top-selling pickup trucks. 
                    With a sharp-edged exterior that is made of scratch- and dent-resistant stainless steel, Tesla's all-electric truck is seriously tough. 
                    Along with available all-wheel drive, the Cybertruck can tow up to 14,000 pounds and has an estimated driving range of 500-plus miles. 
                    While that applies only to the most expensive model, the cheapest one starts at $39,900. Of course, there's still a lot we don't know about the Cybertruck, 
                    including when it will officially go on sale. 
                    Right now, it looks as if the first versions will go into production in late 2022.

                <br/>
                <h3>ATV (Cyberquad)</h3>
				<p> Get ready for any adventure with the all-electric Cyberquad for Kids. Inspired by our iconic Cybertruck design, 
                    the four-wheel ATV features a full steel frame, cushioned seat and adjustable suspension with rear disk braking and LED light bars. 
                    Powered by a lithium-ion battery with up to 15 miles of range and a configurable top speed of 10 mph, 
                    Cyberquad for Kids is suitable for anyone 8-years old and up.

                <br/>
                <h3>Semi</h3>
				<p> First announced in 2017, the all-electric truck is the company’s first foray into non-consumer vehicles. 
                    It’s expected to cover most existing journeys currently undertaken by diesel trucks, with some welcome improvements like a central seating position and dual touchscreens. 
                    While relatively elusive since its 2017 debut, evidence suggests it could launch soon.
