                <h1>What Is Apple Silicon Chip (Processor)</h1>
				<br/><br/>
				<h3>Apple Silicon chip</h3>
				<p>Apple at WWDC 2020 announced plans to transition away from Intel chips to Macs built with its own Apple silicon chips starting in late 2020. 
                    Apple's custom chips are Arm-based and are similar to the A-series chips used in iPhones and iPads, and Apple unveiled the first Apple silicon Macs in November 2020. 
                    The second Apple silicon Macs came in 2021,
                    and now the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac lineups all feature machines with M-series chips.
                    <br/><br/>
                    M-series chips feature Apple's first "System on a Chip" design for the Mac, and it integrates several different components including the CPU, 
                    GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, 
                    Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac.
                    The ‌M1‌, ‌M1 Pro‌, and ‌M1 Max‌ chips are the most powerful chips that Apple has created to date, handily beating out much higher-end Intel chips.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The ‌M1‌ features an 8-core CPU with four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores and an 8-core GPU. 
                    The ‌M1 Pro‌ features a 10-core CPU with eight high performance cores and two high efficiency cores along with a 16-core GPU 
                    (though there is an entry-level version with 8-core CPU and 14-core GPU).
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Why Apple Made the Switch</h3>
				<p>
					Apple is adopting its own Apple silicon chips to make better Macs. Apple's chips bring a whole new level of performance with more powerful Macs that are also more energy-efficient.
                     Apple says that its advanced power management capabilities allow for maximized performance paired with better than ever battery life of up to 21 hours.
                     That's double the battery life of some prior-generation Intel-based Macs.

                <br/>
				<h3>Apple silicon Advantage</h3>
				<p>
					Apple has years of experience with power-efficient chip design thanks to its work on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, all of which use custom-designed chips developed by Apple engineers. 
                    Apple has made huge gains in processor performance over the years, and its chips are now more than powerful enough to be used in Macs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Apple aimed to deliver the highest possible performance with the lowest power consumption, a goal that its expertise made it well-suited to achieve. 
                    Better performance and efficiency were Apple's main goals, but there are other reasons that the company decided to transition away from Intel, 
                    and that includes all of the custom technologies that are built into Apple silicon to further boost the Mac's capabilities and make it stand out from the competition.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Deep integration between software and hardware has always made iPhones stand out from other smartphones, and the same is true for the Mac. Apple's custom chips provide best-in-class security with the Secure Enclave and high-performance graphics capabilities for pro apps and games, 
                    but the true performance gains remain to be seen.

				<h3>Current Arm-Based Macs</h3>
				<p>
					Apple has released the 2020 ‌‌MacBook Air‌‌, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ with ‌M1‌ chips, replacing the low-end machines in those lineups. In 2021, Apple added the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ models, the ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌, and the ‌M1 Pro‌ and ‌M1 Max‌ MacBook Pro models.
				</p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
				<h3>Future Arm-Based Macs</h3>
				<p>Apple is working on updated Apple silicon chips designed for the Mac Pro, 27-inch ‌iMac‌, and high-end ‌Mac mini‌, according to Bloomberg.

                    The ‌Mac mini‌ and ‌iMac‌ could use the same ‌M1 Pro‌ and ‌M1 Max‌ chips introduced in the 2021 MacBook Pro models, while Apple is also working on even higher-powered chips for the ‌Mac Pro‌. The chip that's in the works for the ‌Mac Pro‌ will feature two processors that are either twice or four times as powerful as the MacBook Pro chip. These chips will feature 20 or 40 computing cores with 16 high-performance or 32 high-performance cores and four or eight high-efficiency cores, along with 64 and 128 core options for graphics.
                    
                    For the 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌, there's an M2 chip that will feature a 9 or 10-core CPU and more GPU power. Apple is also likely to develop ‌M2‌ Pro and ‌M2‌ Max chips for its Pro machines. Next-generation chips are expected to use an enhanced version of TSMC's 5-nanometer process and will feature two dies, allowing for more cores.
                    
                    According to The Information, third-generation Apple silicon chips will offer a bigger performance leap, with TSMC using its third-nanometer process. The chips could have up to four dies, which could equate to up to 40 CPU cores. TSMC is expected to be able to manufacture 3-nanometer chips by 2023, and they'll come first in higher-end Macs like the MacBook Pro models.</p>
