                <h1>Why I like Python and How we learn Python?</h1>
				<br>
				<h3>Python</h3>
				<p>Python is a verry commen language amoung the beginers. It is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
					Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
					Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
					Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. 
					Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Benefits of Learning Python</h3>
				<p>
					i. &nbsp&nbsp&nbspCompatible with a variety of platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and others<br/>
					ii. &nbsp Uses a simple syntax comparable to the English language that lets developers use fewer lines than other programming languages<br/>
					iii. &nbspOperates on an interpreter system that allows code to be executed immediately, fast-tracking prototyping<br/>
					iv. &nbspCan be handled in a procedural, object-orientated, or functional way<br/>
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Uses of Python</h3>
				<p>
					Creating web applications on a server<br/>
					Building workflows that can be used in conjunction with software<br/>
					Connecting to database systems<br/>
					Reading and modifying files<br/>
					Performing complex mathematics<br/>
					Processing big data<br/>
					Fast prototyping<br/>
					Developing production-ready software<br/>

				<h3>2 Steps to Learn Python</h3>
				<br>
				<h4>Step 1: Figure Out What Motivates You to Learn Python</h4>
				<p>
					Before you start diving into learning Python online, it’s worth asking yourself why you want to learn it. This is because it’s going to be a long and sometimes painful journey. Without enough motivation, you probably won’t make it through. For example, I slept through high school and college programming classes when I had to memorize syntax and I wasn’t motivated. 
					On the other hand, when I needed to use Python to build a website to automatically score essays, I stayed up nights to finish it.
					<br/>
					Figuring out what motivates you will help you figure out an end goal, and a path that gets you there without boredom. You don’t have to figure out an exact project, just a general area you’re interested in as you prepare to learn Python.
					<br/><br/>
					Pick an area you’re interested in, such as:<br/><br/>
					Data science / Machine learning<br/>
					Mobile apps<br/>
					Websites<br/>
					Games<br/>
					Data processing and analysis<br/>
					Hardware / Sensors / Robots<br/>
					Scripts to automate your work<br/>
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Step 2: Learn the Basics</h4>
				<p>
				This is the most important step. In this stage you want to follow some tutorials on Youtube, Coursera, Udemy, Linkedin Learning, Solo Learn, etc...
				While learning You must follow the main syntaxes and main functions and OOP (Object Orientated Programming) concepts. 
				Also the don't foget to use python practicle testings, Because it will helps to improve your skills and knowladge.
                </p>
